# News_Authentication_Project

This project tackles the pressing issue of misinformation in the digital age by a robust machine learning-based system capable of classifying news articles based on their authenticity. Leveraging TF-IDF vectorization for effective feature extraction and the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for efficient classification, the system delivers accurate, scalable, and lightweight predictions. Beyond its predictive capability, the project emphasizes transparency and user trust by integrating explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which help users understand the rationale behind each classification. This approach aligns with the broader goals of ethical and responsible AI, ensuring that the system functions not as an opaque black box, but as a transparent, interpretable advisor. The inclusion of confidence-based real-time learning further enhances the modelâ€™s ability to adapt to evolving patterns in misinformation 
What sets this apart from other Fake News Detection Projects is the capability to classify even the most recent news articles, due to it's realtime training capability. The more the project runs, the smarter the model gets.
